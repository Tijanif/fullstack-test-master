## Your decisions logs

## Did not understand how to use the generateOffice365Schedule

So I created my own week and timeslots using the generateMockUpResponse function.

## Added Cors

Was having issues with fetching - so added cors in the server index.js to avoid the issue with cors.

## Small helper functions

created small helper functions such as dateAbb, dayNames and avilable to make my life easier in the daysOfTheWeek component.
